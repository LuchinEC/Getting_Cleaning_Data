# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

The original Data base was transformed, following the next steps

1. Assing column names to x_train and x_test databases using Featrures database
2. Rename the variables of each dataset, so that it is easier to identify each of them at the time of merging
3. Merge the train and the test databases in order to create just one data base
4. Subset the merged data set, to get only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Name the activities in the data set, according to descriptive activity given in the activity_labels dataset, this can be done using merge or joints
6. Aggregate the data to get the summary statistics needed, in this case to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# About the code

The file run_analysis.r contains all the programming task developed in order to transform the original data-

# Data sets and Variables used

*x_train, y_train, subject_train, x_test, y_test, subject_test are de datasets dowloaded
*features contains the names of each od the x_test variables
*master_data, is the result of merging all the data bases
*master_mean_sd is the data base that has only de information about mean and sd for each measurement
*TidyDataSet is the final dataset
